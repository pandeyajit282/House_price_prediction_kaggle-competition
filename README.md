#  Kaggle House Price Prediction Competition

### Project Overview
 - This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle House Price Prediction competition. The objective of this competition was to predict house prices based on a set of      features using regression techniques. I participated in this competition, implemented various regression models, and achieved a rank of 3200 with a score of 0.196. This     README provides an overview of the project, the data, the models used, and how to reproduce the results.

Data Source
The dataset for this competition can be found on the Kaggle competition page. It includes a training set and a test set, each with various features related to houses.

Data Preprocessing
Before modeling, I conducted thorough data preprocessing, which included handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables. The preprocessed data was then split into training and validation sets.

Models
I experimented with several regression models to predict house prices. Here are the models I tried:

Ridge Regression: Used to mitigate multicollinearity and overfitting.
Random Forest Regression: Provided the best R-squared value during experimentation.
XGBoost Regression: Another powerful ensemble model.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): Explored SVR as it can handle non-linear relationships.
After evaluating these models, I selected Random Forest Regression as the final model due to its superior performance.

Results
My final model achieved an R-squared value of 0.196 on the Kaggle competition leaderboard, resulting in a rank of 3200 out of [total number of participants]. While the model performed well, there is always room for improvement, and further feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning could potentially enhance the results.

Usage
To reproduce the results or explore the code, follow these steps:
